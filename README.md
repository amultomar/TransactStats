Product Transactions Dashboard - MERN Stack

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application designed to manage and visualize product transaction data. It allows users to view and analyze transactions for different months, with insights into total sales, item statistics, and price ranges.

Key features include:

Transaction Table: Users can view transaction data for the selected month, with the ability to search by product title, description, or price, and navigate through pages with pagination.
Monthly Statistics: Displays key metrics such as total sales, sold items, and unsold items for the chosen month.
Visualizations: Interactive Bar and Pie charts show product data in terms of price ranges and item categories, helping users quickly grasp trends.
Responsive UI: The interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile, ensuring a smooth user experience on any device.
The app utilizes React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Axios is used for making API calls, while Chart.js is integrated for generating charts.

This project serves as a powerful tool for businesses and users looking to analyze and track their product sales and transaction data across different months.
